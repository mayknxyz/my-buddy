# Journal — 2026-02-10

Productive day. Kicked off the [[acme-website]] project with a successful meeting with [[john-doe|John]] from [[acme-corp]].

## What I Did

- Had kickoff meeting with [[acme-corp]] — aligned on scope and timeline
- Set up the [[acme-website]] repository with Astro and Tailwind
- Configured CI/CD pipeline on Cloudflare Pages
- Sent first invoice ([[inv-001]]) to [[john-doe|John]]

## Reflections

Good momentum starting the new project. The client is technically savvy which should make collaboration smoother. Need to stay on top of the [[design-mockups]] task to hit the February 25 deadline.
