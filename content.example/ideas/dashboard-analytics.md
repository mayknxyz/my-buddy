# Dashboard Analytics Module

Idea for a reusable analytics dashboard module that could be offered as an add-on to client projects.

## Concept

Build a lightweight, embeddable analytics component that visualizes key business metrics. Could be productized and offered as a standard add-on to web projects.

## Features to Explore

- Real-time visitor analytics
- Conversion funnel visualization
- Custom event tracking
- Privacy-first approach (no cookies)

## Market Opportunity

If the [[globex-corp]] dashboard opportunity materializes through [[globex-corp-dashboard]], the learnings could be abstracted into a reusable module.

## Next Steps

- Research existing lightweight analytics solutions
- Prototype basic dashboard with mock data
- Estimate development effort for production-ready module
