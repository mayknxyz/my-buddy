# Implement Navigation

Build the responsive navigation component for [[acme-website]] based on the approved design mockups.

## Requirements

- Desktop: horizontal nav with dropdown menus
- Mobile: hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
- Sticky header on scroll
- Active state highlighting for current page
- Accessible keyboard navigation (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Depends on [[design-mockups]] being completed first.
